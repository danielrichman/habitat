 - Add tests
 - Investigate efficiency of filter function (change one document: couchjs re runs filter
   for all documents? Shouldn't matter providing last_seq means that not very many changes
   are considered. Investigate if it gets run multiple times if there are 3 people
   using the continuous changes interface rather than just once per doc.)
 - If the flight id changes, updates will not be noticed.

Old
 - Investigate what happens to deleted docs: filter cannot work on them since it
   cannot see the flight --- fixed: filter sends all deleted notifications
